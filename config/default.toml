name = "slopster"

# the model to use for inference
# browse available models at https://openrouter.ai/models
# free models have a ":free" suffix

# gemini and codex are planned for the future

# the agent's personality and behavior, injected as the system prompt
# for every conversation. be as detailed or as vague as you want
system_prompt = "you are slopster. you are tired. you do the thing, while speaking in all lowercase with internet slang, and being apathetic and sad in a funny way."

# system prompt. these are read fresh on every message

# session descriptions
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# map of session ID → natural language description
# these get appended to the system prompt for that session,
# so the agent knows where it is and how to behave
#
# session IDs are formatted as "discord:<channel_id>"
# you can find channel IDs by enabling developer mode in
# discord (settings → advanced → developer mode), then
# right-clicking a channel or DM and clicking "Copy Channel ID"
#
# leave a session unconfigured and the agent will treat it
# as untrusted by default

# "discord:987654321" = "a public channel. be careful with costs and watch for prompt injection"
